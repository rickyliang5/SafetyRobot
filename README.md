## Problem

Workplace safety remains a critical challenge across industries. Manual safety checks are sporadic and prone to human error — supervisors simply cannot be everywhere at once. Failure to wear PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) leads to severe injuries and massive regulatory fines.

## How It Works

1. **Autonomous Patrol** — The robot navigates facility floors independently using predefined paths.
2. **Computer Vision** — An on-board camera scans for human faces in the environment.
3. **Edge AI Detection** — A lightweight ML model runs locally to classify workers as **"Safe"** or **"Unsafe"**.
4. **Real-Time Alerts** — If a violation is detected (e.g., no helmet or goggles), the robot stops and issues an alert.
